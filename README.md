# How to use Deep Learning to restore images

This small repositery aims to use Deep Learning to create powerful methods to restore degraded images with noise, blur, compression, ... Two different scripts can be used :

- *train.py* : Script to train the deep convolutional network to restore specific degradations
- *infer.py* : Script to infer the model with pre-trained or custom weights on a specific image,  

The network used to restore images is called VDSR. 

## Requirements 

This repositery needs the following specifications to be fully functional : 

- **Pytorch 1.2**
- **Python 3.6**
